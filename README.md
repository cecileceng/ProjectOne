##About Troll Bridge
First big group project during our Coding Boot Camp 

One of the costs of participating in social media is from time to time having to deal with trolls -- a troll according to Wikipedia refers to a "person who sows discord on the Internet by starting arguments or upsetting people, by posting inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the deliberate intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion, often for their own amusement."

So what's the point of this app? Sometimes, we just don't have time to dive into the nitty gritty of everyone's social media presence. So Troll Bridge is here to do that for you.

tl;dr -- Quick way to score how positive or negative someone is (and about what topics) on Twitter
